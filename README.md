# Sales-Analysis-and-Predictions

Problem Statement:
The objective of this project was to develop an interactive sales dashboard for a retail store, aimed at providing a comprehensive view of sales performance across a diverse range of items, outlet types, and locations. With data encompassing over 1,000 items, the challenge was to effectively analyze and visualize sales data to generate actionable insights and predictions.

Approach:
To tackle this challenge, we started by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib to understand the underlying patterns and trends in the sales data. Following the EDA, we handled missing values through univariate and multivariate imputation techniques, and then proceeded with feature engineering, label encoding, and feature scaling to prepare the dataset for modeling.

We then created training and testing sets and proceeded to train and evaluate four different machine learning and deep learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The models were assessed based on their RÂ² scores to gauge their efficiency in predicting sales performance.

Conclusion:
This project resulted in the successful development of an interactive sales dashboard that offers a detailed view of sales performance across various dimensions. Through rigorous data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation, we were able to generate accurate sales predictions and valuable insights, enhancing the store's ability to make informed business decisions.
